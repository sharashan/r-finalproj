    "text": "Data cleaning\n\nHow we Collected the Data from the API:\nThe data was first collected by making API calls from https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3 for various soccer leagues. We did this my making a GET request to their top scorers endpoint, supplying parameters for each of 27 top leagues in 2021. From this we collected 20 goal scorers for each respective league as we specified per the query string parameters. The main challenge faced during this process was being able to take the JSON returned from the HTTP request and actually put it into a data frame. From this point, we used the jsonlite library to flatten the JSON API responses into a tibble and then exported the tibble to a CSV file.\n\n\nHow we Sanitized the Data:\nOnce we had our data stored in a CSV file, we wrote code to load it in R and then began the cleaning process. The main reason why we stored the data to a CSV rather than dynamically making API calls is due to the rate limits and fees associated with using the API. The API we were using enforces strict rate-limits and beyond the free tier of the service they charge for additional requests.\nFor the main cleaning process, we utilized the clean_names function from the janitor library to make sure our variable names conform to R naming conventions. After this, we dropped the columns we would not be using by employing a select statement on our data frame. Originally, our data set had columns that were relevant to goalkeepers, defenders, and other players that are not primarily goalscorers. We also noticed that our height and weight columns were not sanitized and in character form versus numeric, thus we sanitized these columns added the units to the variable name and dropped the old columns. Lastly, we made sure to remove any columns that appeared to be duplicates like player_id_48, player_id_1, and player_firstname.\n\n\n\nOther appendicies (as necessary)\n\nOriginal Code for Communicating w/ API:\n\n(Credits to RapidAPI + Stackoverflow for assistance)\nThe code below will not be runnable without creating an API key for api-football.

Therefore, we cannot make comparisons within groups (player, team, or league) over time.\nThere are no goalies in the dataset (best scorers i.e. offensive players) therefore, we are unable to assess a team’s defense, which is important when considering how good a team is!\n\n\n\nExploratory data analysis\nPerform an (initial) exploratory data analysis.\n\n# height vs bookings  \nsoccer_clean |>\n  mutate(\n    total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_yellowred\n  ) |>\nggplot(mapping = aes(x = player_height_cm, y = total_bookings)) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Player Height (in cm)\",\n    y = \"Bookings\",\n    title = \"Player Height vs. Bookings\"\n  )\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 34 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 34 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n# player rating vs goal accuracy\n# would need to transform, and/or implement axis limits\nsoccer_clean |>\n  mutate(\n    goal_acc = goals_total/shots_total\n  ) |>\nggplot(mapping = aes(x = games_rating, y = goal_acc)) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Rating\",\n    y = \"Goal Accuracy\",\n    title = \"Rating vs. Goal Accuracy\"\n  )\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 124 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 124 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n# median number of goals by different football leagues\nsoccer_clean |>\n  group_by(league_name) |>\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = goals_total, y = league_name)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Number of Goals\",\n    y = \"League\",\n    title = \"Median Goals by League\"\n  )\n\n\n\n# goals vs bookings\nsoccer_clean |>\n  mutate(\n    total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_yellowred\n  ) |>\nggplot(mapping = aes(x = goals_total, y = total_bookings)) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Number of Goals\",\n    y = \"Bookings\",\n    title = \"Goals vs. Bookings\"\n  )\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n# player height vs goal accuracy\n#may need axis limits or just use goals_total if that gives better model instead of goal_acc\nsoccer_clean |>\n  mutate(\n        goal_acc = goals_total/shots_total\n  ) |>\nggplot(mapping = aes(x = player_height_cm, y = goal_acc)) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Player Height (in cm)\",\n    y = \"Goal Accuracy\",\n    title = \"Player Height vs. Goal accuracy\"\n  )\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 131 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 131 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for reviewers\n\nHow many research questions should we have– if only one or two, which ones do you suggest?\nThe data we are using is already pretty tidy (tidied when converting from API –> JSON –> CSV), therefore there are minimal cleaning steps in R-- confirming that this is acceptable, as it was indicated in the proposal directions that using an API was OK."

    "text": "The motivation behind this project was to determine whether or not there were relationships between soccer players, leagues, and their respective statistics. Each observation represents a player, and columns represent descriptors such as height, weight, nationality, passes, goals scored, assists, penalties, etc. Since soccer is such a popular global sport, we aimed to answer the following research questions in our project:\n\nRQ 1 (Players): What factors influence booking frequency of players? Some factors we considered were player height, weight, age, and player rating.\nRQ 2 (Leagues): Does aggressiveness differ between European and non-European leagues? Aggressiveness was indirectly measured through average penalties per game, average goals per minute, average shots per game, and average number of duels per game.\n\nAfter conducting data analysis, it was discovered that the data does provide convincing evidence that the ratings of players influence the booking frequency, while other variables such as height and age were not statistically significant. In addition, there was convincing evidence that the average number of duels per game differ between European and non-European leagues. However, the data does not provide convincing evidence that the average goals per minute differ between European and non-European leagues, when measuring aggressiveness, and the variable of average shots per game was found to be not statistically significant."

The people involved are football players, who are aware of data collection, as this occurs during and after all of their games because sports data is typically used to make general comparisons (past/future versions of themselves, comparing their team to another, or between leagues, sports reporting (to football fans), or MVP decisions. In the dataset of soccer player statistics, some instances may have missing information for certain attributes. This is due to the fact that each league may prioritize and record specific statistics that they find important, resulting in variations in the recorded statistics across different leagues. Additionally, some leagues are smaller than others and may not have the same telemetry.\nThe relationships between the individual instances (players) are made explicit through the tabular structure, where each row corresponds to a specific player, and each column represents their associated statistics. As this is game data, it was likely influenced by referee rulings, as some scores may not have counted in the final game statistics."

We made a GET request to their top scorers’ endpoint, supplying parameters for each of the 27 top leagues in 2021. From this, we collected 20 goal scorers for each league as we specified per the query string parameters. From this point, we used the jsonlite library to flatten the JSON API responses into a tibble and then exported the table to a CSV file.\nThe data used in our analysis were collected throughout the respective football seasons of each league in the year 2021. Although the start date and duration of each league’s season may have varied slightly, all instances were associated with data from their respective leagues’ defined 2021 football season.\nThe data we utilized was not directly collected from individual soccer players. Instead, scorekeepers initially recorded it during each game and subsequently compiled it into a comprehensive dataset by the API Football team.\nThe people involved are football players, who are aware of data collection, as this occurs during and after all of their games because sports data is typically used to make general comparisons (past/future versions of themselves, comparing their team to another, or between leagues, sports reporting (to football fans), or MVP decisions."

The main reason why we stored the data to a CSV rather than dynamically making API calls is due to the rate limits and fees associated with using the API. For the main cleaning process, we utilized the clean_names function from the janitor library to make sure our variable names conform to R naming conventions. After this, we dropped the columns we would not be using by employing a select statement on our data frame. Originally, our data set had columns that were relevant to goalkeepers, defenders, and other players that are not primarily goalscorers. We also noticed that our height and weight columns were not sanitized and in character form versus numeric, thus we sanitized these columns added the units to the variable name and dropped the old columns. Lastly, we made sure to remove any columns that appeared to be duplicates like player_id_48, player_id_1, and player_firstname."

Furthermore, based on our side-by-side box plot representing the distribution of total bookings for highly rated players vs non-highly rated players in our explanatory data analysis, it appeared as though non-highly ranked players get booked more frequently. However, the visualization itself did not tell us if that difference was significant. In the following section, we will conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate this."

We also compared European leagues against non-European leagues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the EDA, it is difficult to discern whether there which leagues are more than aggressive than others.\nIdentifying Important Predictors: Next, we fit a logistic regression line that predicted whether the league group was European or not, based on above variables to determine if any were actually statistically significant, and worth investigating through a hypothesis test in our “Evaluation of Significance” section:\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  term                 estimate std.error statistic     p.value\n  <chr>                   <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>       <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)          -1.98      0.489      -4.04  0.0000528  \n2 avg_penalty_by_game  -2.76      1.51       -1.82  0.0686     \n3 avg_goals_per_min   305.       65.9         4.62  0.00000387 \n4 avg_shots_per_game   -0.196     0.210      -0.932 0.351      \n5 duels_total           0.00564   0.00106     5.29  0.000000120\n\n\nBased on our results, average goals per minute and total duels were the only predictors with p-values < the significance level, 0.05 (at 3.869903e-06 and 1.195738e-07, respectively). In the following section, we will conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate the difference in “aggressiveness” of European and non-European leagues."
