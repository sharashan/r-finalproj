# Analysis #1

Question: What factors influence booking frequency of the players?

Hypothesis: Taller, heavier, older, and more highly rated players get booked more frequently than shorter, less heavy, younger, less highly rated players.

-   Do taller players (player_height) tend to get booked more frequently (mutate --\> total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_redyellow)?

-   Do heavier players (player_weight) tend to get booked more frequently (mutate --\> total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_redyellow)?

-   Do older players (player_birth_date) tend to get booked more frequently (mutate --\> total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_redyellow)?

-   Do higher rated players (player_birth_date) tend to get booked more frequently (mutate --\> total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_redyellow)?

# Analysis #2

Question: Are some leagues more aggressive, on average, than others?

***SOMEONE NEEDS TO DO THIS\--*** Hypothesis: European leagues are, on average, more aggressive than non-European leagues (i.e. more fouls, more goals per minute, and more duels.)

-   How does the frequency of fouls (cards_yellow, cards_red, cards_redyellow) between different leagues, impact the number of goals scored?

-   How do goals per minutes (on average) (i.e. goals_total / games_minutes and group_by(league)) differ within leagues?

-   Does number of duels (duels_total) differ across leagues?
