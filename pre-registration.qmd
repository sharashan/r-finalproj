Updated Research Question (tentative)--

RQ 1 (Players): Is there a correlation between the height, weight, age, and/or player rating on specific game statistics (Including, but not limited to: goals scored, assists, penalties, passes, etc.)?

**QUESTION: should new phrase as "different from" or ask as specifically "heavier/taller, better"**

-   Do taller players (player_height) tend to get booked more frequently (mutate --\> total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_redyellow)?

-   Do heavier players (player_weight) tend to get booked more frequently (mutate --\> total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_redyellow)?

-   Do older players (player_birth_date) tend to get booked more frequently (mutate --\> total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_redyellow)?

-   Do higher rated players (player_birth_date) tend to get booked more frequently (mutate --\> total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_redyellow)?

-   Do taller players (player_height) tend to score more (goals_total)?

-   Do heavier players (player_weight) tend to score more (goals_total)?

-   Do older players (player_birth_date) tend to score more (goals_total)?

-   Do higher rated players (player_birth_date) tend to score more (goals_total)?

-   Do taller players (player_height) tend to have higher goal accuracy (mutate --\> goal_acc = goals_total / shots_total)?

-   Do heavier players (player_weight) tend to have higher goal accuracy (mutate --\> goal_acc = goals_total / shots_total)?

-   Do older players (player_birth_date) tend to have higher goal accuracy (mutate --\> goal_acc = goals_total / shots_total)?

-   Do higher rated players (player_birth_date) tend to have higher goal accuracy (mutate --\> goal_acc = goals_total / shots_total)?

RQ 2 (Leagues): Do game statistics differ across leagues (goals_total)?

-   Are some leagues (leagues) outputting more goals than others?

-   Does penalty accuracy rate vary across leagues? (i.e. mutate -\> penalty_acc = penalty_scored / (penalty_missed + penalty_scored))

-   How does the frequency of fouls (cards_yellow, cards_red, cards_redyellow) between different leagues, impact the number of goals scored?

-   How do goals per minutes (on average) (i.e. goals_total / games_minutes and group_by(league)) differ within leagues?

-   Does number of duels (duels_total) differ across leagues?

# Analysis #1

Ex/ Distribution of median number of goals by league (European and Non-European).

# Analysis #2

Ex/ Rating vs. goal accuracy (i.e. goals_total / shots_total)
