Updated Research Question (tentative)--

RQ 1 (Players): Is there a correlation between the height, weight, age, and/or player rating on specific game statistics (Including, but not limited to: goals scored, assists, penalties, passes, etc.)?

**QUESTION: should new phrase as "different from" or ask as specifically "heavier/taller, better"**

-   Do taller players (player_height) tend to get booked more frequently (mutate --\> total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_redyellow)?

-   Do heavier players (player_weight) tend to get booked more frequently (mutate --\> total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_redyellow)?

-   Do older players (player_birth_date) tend to get booked more frequently (mutate --\> total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_redyellow)?

-   Do higher rated players (player_birth_date) tend to get booked more frequently (mutate --\> total_bookings = cards_yellow + cards_red + cards_redyellow)?

# Analysis #1

Ex/ Distribution of median number of goals by league (European and Non-European).

# Analysis #2

Ex/ Rating vs. goal accuracy (i.e. goals_total / shots_total)
