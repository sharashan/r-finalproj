# Team Aggrement

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This agreement is a *living* document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Team name

skillful-pikachu

## To what goals do we all commit?

Work ahead and communicate throughout the project and show up to weekly check-ins and make sure to communicate about when we meet up.

## Weekly meetings

Tuesday 6-8 PM

## Meeting "location"

Zoom

## Primary method of communication

text message

## How should someone notify the others if they cannot attend a lab or scheduled team meeting?

Ideally 24 hours in advance so we are aware of potential issues that may arise.

## By when should everyone have their portion of the lab completed?

Have it done by the discussion but if we are not meeting then have it done by our Tuesday meeting.

## How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable?

What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

Communicate with the team member early and check-in. Honesty and transparency is key. In the event that a team member isn't contributing equally we would reach out to them and make sure that all of the goals are being communicated and there is something that could be done from preventing this sort of thing from happening in the future.

## What else do we want to include in this agreement?

Maybe your team needs a *fun* clause...

**Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

Get ice-cream at the end. :)

## Using your agreement

You are expected to follow your team agreement. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the agreement.** If the agreement isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the agreement, please email the instructor at \<info2950\@cornell.edu\>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the agreement?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your agreement to resolve the issue?" You should attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
